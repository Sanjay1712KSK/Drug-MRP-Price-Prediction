# First ML Project â€“ Machine Learning with Python & Docker

## Project Overview
This project is my first hands-on experience in machine learning. It demonstrates the complete workflow of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model using **Python**. The API and database connections are managed through **Docker**, ensuring a consistent and portable development environment.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training and testing.  
- **Model Development:** Implemented and trained ML models to solve the given problem.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
- **Containerized Deployment:** Used **Docker** to configure the API and database connections for easy deployment and reproducibility.  
- **Development Environment:** Fully developed using **VS Code**.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Tools & Platforms:** VS Code, Docker  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
